Growth in Nashville

Capstone Project for Data Analytics Cohort 12 at Nashville Software School

Nashville has been growing rapidly since I moved here in 2017. In this project I dive deeper into what that growth has looked like over the years. What neighborhoods is this growth happening in? What types of buildings are being built, and where?

Motivation

About 7 years ago I graduated college in my home state of Ohio. The weekend after my graduation, I moved from a state known for flat landscapes, cornfields, and Skyline Chili to Music City. I immediately fell in love with my neighborhood of East Nashville. There was (and still is) so much excitement and growth in my neighborhood and entire city. I had never lived in a place with so many new home builds, new developments, and new restaurants. It felt like every corner had some sort of new and fun development and another reason to love living in Nashville. 

When working as a Sales Engineer at a commercial ventilation company, I was able to help manage and design projects for bew hotels, apartments, schools, government buildings, restaurants and more. I had a first hand look at all of the excitement happening in Music City. Though I realized that this development was happening unevenly. I am always curious about what the next "hot spot" neighborhood is. Through publicly available datasets, I was able to transform my curiosity to data driven insights.
