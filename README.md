# Growth in Nashville

Capstone Project for Data Analytics Cohort 12 at Nashville Software School

Nashville has been growing rapidly since I moved here in 2017. In this project I dive deeper into what that growth has looked like over the years. What neighborhoods is this growth happening in? What types of buildings are being built, and where?

## Motivation

Seven years ago, I graduated from college in my home state of Ohio. Shortly after, I made the move from Ohio—a state known for its flat landscapes, cornfields, and Skyline Chili—to the vibrant city of Nashville, Tennessee. Upon settling into East Nashville, I quickly grew fond of the neighborhood’s energy and rapid growth. The area, like much of the city, was booming with new home constructions, commercial developments, and an ever-expanding list of restaurants. It seemed that every corner had something new, adding to my appreciation of living in Nashville.

During my time as a Sales Engineer at a commercial ventilation company, I had the opportunity to manage and design projects for various types of buildings, including hotels, apartments, schools, government facilities, and restaurants. This role gave me an inside view of the ongoing development across the city. However, I noticed that this growth was not evenly distributed. My curiosity about the emergence of "hot spot" neighborhoods led me to dive deeper into the data. By leveraging publicly available datasets, I transformed my curiosity into data-driven insights to better understand the patterns of urban development in Nashville.
